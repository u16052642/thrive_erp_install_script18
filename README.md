# [Thrive](https://www.thrivebureau.com "Thrive ERP's Homepage") Install Script

This script is based on the install script from Andr√© Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts)
but goes a bit further and has been improved. This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/
This script can be safely used in a multi-thrive code base server because the default Odoo port is changed BEFORE the Odoo is started.


##### 1. Download the script:
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaheenHossain/thrive_install_script_16ent/divinlonji_thrive_ent1867/thrive1867_install.sh

sudo chmod +x thrive1867_install.sh

sudo ./thrive1867_install.sh
